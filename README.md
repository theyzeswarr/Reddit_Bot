To help for customer quires, here we have created this API based Reddit Bot

Reddit Bot 

Create a Reddit Account: If you don't already have one, visit the Reddit website (https://www.reddit.com) and create a new account.

Enable Developer Mode: Once you have a Reddit account, go to your Reddit account settings (https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps). Scroll down to the "App" section and click on the "Create App" button.

Fill in Application Details: On the "Create Application" page, provide the following details for your application:

Name: Choose a unique name for your application.
App type: Select "Script" for a personal use script application.
Description: Provide a brief description of your application.
About URL and Redirect URI: Leave these fields empty.
Agree to Terms and Create App: Check the box to indicate that you understand Reddit's API terms and conditions, and click on the "Create app" button to create your application.

Obtain Client ID and Client Secret: Once your application is created, you will see the "personal use script" details. Make note of the "client ID" and "client secret" values. These will be used to authenticate your application when making API requests.

With the client ID and client secret obtained, you can use them to generate an access token for authenticating API requests. The exact method for generating a token will depend on the programming language or library you are using to interact with the Reddit API.
